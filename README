GunderCrypt Toy Text Cipher
(C)2012-2015 Christian Gunderman
Formerly at sourceforge.net/p/gundercrypt

This is a toy cipher class implementing pseudo-random shifting, combined with password protected letter shifts (GunderCrypt.java) that may be embedded in your project to provide simple ciphering for any A-Z text messages. Note: I make no guaruntees about the security of this code. It should not be used as a replacement for actual encryption.

Important Details:
 - Released under latest GNU GPL license
 - Use GunderCrypt.encodeString() and GunderCrypt.decodeString() to encrypt your Strings.
 - GunderCryptCli.java is a command line interface that demonstrates functionality.
 - Messages are encrypted more securely the more words that are present.
 - Passwords must be ONLY uppercase letters and spaces. No lowercase or numbers.

Building:
 - Install gradle build system - UBUNTU - sudo apt-get install gradle
                               - Download from gradle.org under Windows.
 - Build                       - gradle build

Run:
 java -jar build/libs/gundercrypt.jar encode "I love cookies" "PASSWORD"

   It will respond something similar to following (though it can be VERY different each time due to the pseudo random encryption algorithm):
   
   FRrVU Mztqh HlqhutmfLiE

   To decode the text, run GunderCryptCli like so:
   ./GunderCrypt.jar decode "FRrVU Mztqh HlqhutmfLiE" "PASSWORD"


Enjoy! :)
